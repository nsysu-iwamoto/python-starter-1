# Task 03: FizzBuzz

Open `03_fizzbuzz.py` and edit the file to do the following tasks.

## Task 03a

Complete the FizzBuzz code. Namely, the function `fizzbuzz(n)` should print the numbers from 1 to `n`, but for multiples of three, print `Fizz` instead of the number, and for the multiples of five, print `Buzz`. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five, print `FizzBuzz`.

## Task 03b (optional, advanced)

A Japanese comedian "Nabeatsu of the world" is very famous for its "Nabeatsu FizzBuzz".  He says numbers from one to `n`, but he **says the number foolishly** only when the number is a multiple of three (3, 6, 9, ...) OR the number contains the digit 3 (3, 13, 23, 33, ...).

Implement `nabeatsu(n)` that behaves like Nabeatsu, where you need to think how a computer can display a number foolishly.
