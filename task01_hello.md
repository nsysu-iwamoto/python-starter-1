# Task 01: Hello World!

Open `task01_hello.py` and edit the file to do the following tasks.

## Task 01a

Write a program that prints `Hello, World!` to the console.
That is, if you execute `python3 task01_hello.py` from the command line,
the output should be `Hello, World!`

Here, you should not modify anything outside the `hello_world()` function.

## Task 01b (optional)

To the file, add a function `hello_world_three_times()` that prints `Hello, World!` three times.
Here, try to print them in different manners. For example, you can use "f-string", "string concatenation operator", or other more advanced ways.

You also need to modify "the main part" of the file.

## Task 01c (optional)

Now you want to customize how many times it prints.
Add a function `hello_world_n_times()` that first asks the user how many times it should print `Hello, World!` and then prints it that many times.
You may see `task02_iteration.py` for how to ask for inputs.
