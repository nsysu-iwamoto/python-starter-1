# Task 04: Fibonacci

Open `task04_fibonacci.py` and edit the file to do the following tasks.
Here, we assume Fibonacci sequence begins with 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, and 8.

## Task 04a

Complete the function `fibonacci(goal)` so that it displays the Fibonacci sequence but stops just before the `goal`. For example, `fibonacci(13)` should print

```console:
1
1
2
3
5
8
```

Of course, `fibonacci(9)` should give the same output.

## Task 04b (optional, advanced)

Write a function `fibonacci_to(n)` that displays the Fibonacci sequence up to `n`. However, if `n` is not in the Fibonacci sequence, the function should not print any numbers, but instead, tell that the input `n` is not suitable for this function.

(Does your code work even if the input is extremely large?)
