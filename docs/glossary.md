# Glossary - Programming Terms in Simple English

This document explains common programming terms used in this course.

## Python Terms

### **Function**
A reusable block of code that performs a specific task.

Example: `def hello_world():` creates a function named `hello_world`.

### **Print**
To display text or numbers on the screen.

Example: `print("Hello")` shows "Hello" on the screen.

### **Variable**
A name that stores a value (like a number or text).

Example: `x = 5` stores the number 5 in a variable named `x`.

### **String**
Text enclosed in quotes.

Example: `"Hello, World!"` is a string.

### **Integer** (int)
A whole number (no decimal point).

Example: `5`, `10`, `100` are integers.

### **Loop**
Code that repeats multiple times.

Example: `for i in range(5):` repeats 5 times.

### **Conditional** (if statement)
Code that runs only when a condition is true.

Example: `if x > 5:` runs only when x is greater than 5.

### **Pass**
A placeholder that does nothing. Used when you need code but haven't written it yet.

Example: `pass` means "nothing happens here yet".

### **Modulo** (%)
The remainder after division.

Example: `7 % 3 = 1` (7 divided by 3 is 2 with remainder 1).

### **Divisible**
Can be divided evenly (remainder is 0).

Example: 6 is divisible by 3 because `6 % 3 = 0`.

### **Sequence**
A series of numbers or items in a specific order.

Example: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 is a sequence.

### **Ordinal number**
A number that shows position or order: 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, etc.

Example: "1st" means first, "2nd" means second.

## Git Terms

### **Repository** (repo)
A folder that contains your project and its history.

Think of it like a project folder with memory of all changes.

### **Clone**
To download a copy of a repository to your computer.

Command: `git clone <url>`

### **Commit**
To save a snapshot of your changes with a message.

Command: `git commit -m "message"`

### **Push**
To upload your commits to GitHub.

Command: `git push`

### **Pull**
To download changes from GitHub to your computer.

Command: `git pull`

### **Branch**
A separate version of your code where you can work independently.

Like having a copy where you can experiment safely.

---

## Testing Terms

### **Test**
Code that checks if your code works correctly.

Example: Tests check if your function produces the correct output.

### **Assert**
To check if something is true. If false, the test fails.

Example: `assert x == 5` fails if x is not 5.

### **pytest**
A tool that runs tests automatically.

Command: `python -m pytest`

### **Pass** (test result)
✅ Your code works correctly!

### **Fail** (test result)
❌ Your code has a problem. Read the error message.

### **Skip** (test result)
Test was not run (usually optional problems).

---

## Command Line Terms

### **Terminal** / **Command Line**
A text-based interface where you type commands.

On Mac/Linux: Terminal. On Windows: Command Prompt or PowerShell.

### **Directory**
A folder on your computer.

Example: `cd Documents` changes to the Documents folder.

### **Path**
The location of a file or folder.

Example: `/home/user/Documents/file.txt`

### **stdin** (standard input)
Data that your program receives (usually from keyboard).

Example: When you use `input()`, you're reading from stdin.

### **stdout** (standard output)
Data that your program outputs (usually to screen).

Example: When you use `print()`, you're writing to stdout.

---

## Symbols and Operators

### `=` (assignment)
Stores a value in a variable.

Example: `x = 5` means "x becomes 5".

### `==` (comparison)
Checks if two values are equal.

Example: `x == 5` means "is x equal to 5?"

### `%` (modulo)
Returns the remainder after division.

Example: `7 % 3` returns `1`.

### `+` (addition or concatenation)
Adds numbers OR joins strings.

Example: `5 + 3 = 8` or `"Hello" + " World" = "Hello World"`

### `#` (comment)
Text that Python ignores. Used for notes.

Example: `# This is a comment`

### `:` (colon)
Marks the start of a code block.

Example: `if x > 5:` or `def hello():`

## Tips for Learning English Programming Terms

1. **Type everything yourself** - Don't copy-paste! Typing helps you remember.
2. **Read error messages slowly** - They tell you what's wrong.
3. **Use print() to understand** - Print variables to see their values.
4. **Don't be afraid to experiment** - Try things and see what happens!

Remember: Programming is about solving problems step by step. Take your time! 🚀
