# Task 02: Iteration

Open `02_iteration.py` and edit the file to do the following tasks.

## Task 02a

The function `show_one_to_ten()` currently shows numbers from 0 to 5, which is incorrect.
Correct the function the numbers from 1 to 10 are displayed.

## Task 02b

Correct a function `show_one_to_n()` so that it first asks the user to enter a number `n` and then displays numbers from 1 to `n`.

## Task 02c (optional)

Add a function `show_one_to_n_ordinal()`, which is the same as `show_one_to_n()` but as the ordinal numbers.

Namely, the output should be

```console:
1st
2nd
3rd
4th
```
